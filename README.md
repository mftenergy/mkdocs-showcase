# mkdocs-showcase

This repo is to showcase what mkdocs is and how it can be used to enhance documentation. Mkdocs is a python project made to serve markdown files but it has become highly extendible through community plugins.

Anything is really possible, even raw HTML inline in markdown! It can get really ugly, but beautiful at the same time.. For the reader that is.

## Local usage

Running with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install
mkdocs serve
```
